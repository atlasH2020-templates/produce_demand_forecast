<h2>The "produce_demand_forecaster" ATLAS Service Template</h2>
<div style="margin-left: -22px;">
Abstract

This document describes the specifications for the produce_demand_forecaster service whose purpose is to ....
</div>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

...

<h2>2 Terminology</h2>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

The notation "[xxx]" (xxx in square brackets) is equivalent to "array of xxx".

When used alone, the term "produce_demand_forecaster" refers to "produce_demand_forecaster ATLAS Service Template". Instead, "produce_demand_forecaster service" is equivalent to "an ATLAS Service implementing the produce_demand_forecaster ATLAS Service Template".

<h2>3 Pre-requisites</h2>

A thorough understanding in the following is required for
both service consumers or service provider implementors:
<pre>
    - GeoJSON specifications (<a href="https://geojson.org/">https://geojson.org/</a>)
    - ISO8601 representation of dates and times
      (<a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html</a>)
</pre>
<h2>4 produce_demand_forecaster Usage Scenarios</h2>

The following sections describe some aspects of the use of produce_demand_forecaster. The examples were chosen to illustrate the basic operation of applications using produce_demand_forecaster, not to limit what produce_demand_forecaster may be used for.

<h2>4.1 Short supply chain producer</h2>

The aim is to assist a short supply chain producer in making an informed cultivation
plan. For a producer, the produce_demand_forecaster yields the top consumed produce in
her area per time window. For a given time window, the produce_demand_forecaster yields
the most popular produce measured by the community's demand so that the producer can
plan to sow accordingly.

<h2>4.2 Short supply chain retailer</h2>

The aim is to assist a short supply chain retailer in making an informed procurement
planning and decision. For a retailer, the produce_demand_forecaster yields the top
consumed produce in her area per time window. For a given time window, the
produce_demand_forecaster yields the most popular produce measured by the community's
demand so that the retailer can order accordingly.

<h2>5 Service Template Structure</h2>

The produce_demand_forecaster takes as input the time interval over which the demand
forecast is to be given, as well as geographic input that is fiven in the form of a
three-letter code that abbreviates a city. Currently, the codes (and cities) that are
supported are AMS (Amsterdam), ANT (Antwerp), BER (Berlin) and LUX (Luxembourg). The
available GEO codes can be found by making a request at the **geo** endpoint. This
enpoint returns a list of all supported GEO codes with metadata that describes the value
that the GEO code KEY encodes.

The produce_demand_forecaster serves the forecast over the **forecast** endpoint.

<pre>
+--------------------------------------------+
| forecast                                   |
+-------------+------------------------------+
|      Inputs | Time interval                |
|             | 3-letter GEO code            |
+-------------+------------------------------+
|     Outputs | array of top produce         |
|             | (meta)data                   |
+-------------+------------------------------+
</pre>

<h2>5.1 Invalid GEO code</h2>

An error code 404 with an error message will be returned to the request.

<h2>5.2 Invalid time interval</h2>

An error code 400 with an error message will be returned to the request.

<h2>6 Access and Authentication</h2>

The produce_demand_forecaster is publically available with rate limits.

For less strict rate limits, producers and retailers and  MUST have an account setup on an produce_demand_forecaster service in order to authenticate and access API endpoints. 

To obtain credentials that give access to the endpoints, reach out to the Calabi staff
at info@calabi.be.

Unless specifically documented in the OpenAPI specifications, all API calls must include
credentials in form of Bearer authentication (also called token authentication). Clients
can obtain an access token on behalf of their user from the service's authorization
server (see ATLAS service pairing).

<h2>ANNEX 1 - produce_demand_forecaster GEO codes</h2>

The current list of supported GEO codes. The list is often updated, and the most recent
list van always be obtained by performing a GET request against the **geo** endpoint.

<tr><td>ANT</td><td>Antwerp</td><td>Belgium</td></tr>
<tr><td>AMS</td><td>Amsterdam</td><td>Netherlands</td></tr>
